My family and I (Mum, Dad, 3 sons) have been living in the same house for two years now. We moved in when I was about twelve. As every family seems to do we had a part of a wall were we marked the our heights with the dates over the years. Sadly since me and my middle brother have moved out, my parents are looking for a smaller place. So as not to lose this data (I love data), my mum and I decided to digitize the wall. So here it is.

I found it very interesting that my two younger brothers, where the ages overlap, are at almost identical heights. Also my middle brother had a huge growth spurt from March to May in 2015, growing a total 7cm in that short time span.
